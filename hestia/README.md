Hestia is a secure smarthome solution. 
Hestia Home System consists of Hestia Station (Arduino UNO/Raspberry Pi), backend (PostgressDB + fastAPI) and frontend (Flutter Multiplatform Application)

### Application

This repository holds a multiplatform aplication part of the smarthome system we plan to create.


In current version only temperature tracking shall be availible.
In nearest future with sufficient funds the weather station will be added to controll rooms overall temperature. 
After that we plan to add security system integration and smart devices integration.
